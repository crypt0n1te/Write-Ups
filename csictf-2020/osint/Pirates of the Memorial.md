* Good old Ironstone found the picture in this tweet https://twitter.com/rishibagree/status/1016932954143158274
* In the comments it is mentioned that Arunopal Banerjee is the actual photgrapher
* Visting Arunopal Banerjee's instagram account (There is instagram profile tag in the bottom left corner of the orginal image) yields no results
* But one of his two followers (https://www.instagram.com/arunopal17/) has the picture posted on his account
* The flag is in the comments
