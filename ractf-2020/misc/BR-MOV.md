The link https://youtu.be/zi3pLOaUUXs takes you to a video of someone saying numbers and lots of barcodes flashing.
Put this on playback speed x0.25, and scan each barcode, pausing when necessary.

You should get a list that looks like this:
```5WlndrAehA
8PdGSTvnaY
9zuPGubRMc
7cyqggztfa
6AqGoWfWwR
7JwvAOM{Px
4JIEbOEkws
5NDuG4sOeb
9chPBBYtfr
8iwkHVYpcf
7hVMGQe0xL
3vBdLvZLbB
2T3iNatxiU
5kNLb_eoyi
4AfAmLXyJo
4oFE4iSJmP
3ajdUBIXVe
4oAQnoJxEV
8SzMNoIa3j
9aaIBHbqls
```

The numbers that are being said, you will realise, are the same numbers as the ones at the start of each string above.
So, take the first string and count 8 characters into the string. You get 'r'. 
Do this for each string and you can see where this goes...
