# RAirways

First, have a look at the picture.
After looking at the barcode for a while you realise that the colours on it are the wrong way round.
But theres an easy fix in that you can just invert the colours.

The picture looks quite off so you can either use gimp to make it relatively flatter, or just scan it normally
After scanning with a boarding pass app, you can see in flag in the file data

#### Flag = ractf{B0ard1ngP4SS}
