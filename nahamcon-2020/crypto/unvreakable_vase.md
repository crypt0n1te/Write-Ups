# Unvreakable Vase
The encrypted text we got given was
```
zmxhz3tkb2vzx3roaxnfzxzlbl9jb3vudf9hc19jcnlwdg9vb30=
```

Some fiddling around with the capitalisation of the base64 characters got us the actually-printable string
```
ZmxhZ3tkb2VzX3RoaXNfZXZlbl9jb3VudF9hc19jcnlwdG9vb30=
```
which decoded to yield the flag.
